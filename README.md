# My Portfolio - First Mini Project

This is my first mini-project: a **Portfolio Website** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal of this project was to showcase my personal information, skills, and some of my work in a simple, clean, and responsive design.

## Project Overview

This portfolio website includes the following sections:

- **Home**: A brief introduction and overview of who I am.
- **About Me**: A section where I share my background, education, and career aspirations.
- **Skills**: A list of technical skills I possess, along with a progress bar or indicator for each skill.
- **Projects**: A showcase of some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on or contributed to.
- **Contact**: A contact form where visitors can reach out to me.

The website is fully responsive and works across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). The project was built to demonstrate my front-end skills and my ability to create a simple, professional online presence.

## Technologies Used
